# Hey, I'm Jacob

Hey, I'm Jacob and I am currently working as a Software Engineer in the aerospace industry. My interest in software engineering, and more specifically machine learning, stems from master's degree I recently completed in Mechanical Engineering at the University of British Columbia with the Control Engineering Laboratory. While completing the degree I developed a keen interest in the intersection of control theory and machine learning, as well as in machine learning and software engineering in general. Looking ahead, I am excited about opportunities to apply the knowledge I've gained in these fields to solve complex problems in our everyday world.

In my free time I like reading legal thrillers, listening to rock music, snowboarding, and watching the Leafs/Raps. I also like to think I have a decent sense of humour and love a good adventure in the great Canadian outdoors.

I really just set up this github account to host my personal website, but I had a ton of fun tackling that task and hope to add a few more fun/interesting side projects to this account over the coming years.
