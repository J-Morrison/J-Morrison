# Hey, I'm Jacob

I recently completed a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of British Columbia with the Control Engineering Laboratory, where I developed a keen interest in the intersection of control theory and machine learning. Looking ahead, I am excited about opportunities to pursue this interest and apply the knowledge I've gained to solve complex control problems in our everyday world.

In my free time I like reading legal thrillers, listening to rock music, snowboarding, and watching the Leafs/Raps. I also like to think I have a decent sense of humour and love a good adventure in the great Canadian outdoors.

At this point there's really not much to my github as I just recently set it up to host my personal website. I had a ton of fun tackling that task though, and hope to build it up some more over the coming years with new fun/interesting side projects.
